# Netflix Stock Price Prediction

#### Description:
* This project aims to predict the stock price of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) using historical data and machine learning algorithms.
* It involves various stages of the     data mining process, such as 
1. data cleaning
2. exploratory data analysis
3. feature engineering 
4. model selection
5. evaluation.

#### objective:
* The project's main objective is to build a predictive model that can forecast the future stock prices of Netflix based on past performance.
*  To achieve this goal, we used a dataset of daily stock prices and volume traded from February 2018 to February 2022
* Next, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify potential features that could help predict stock prices.
* We then used machine learning algorithm as linear regression.
* The project's results indicate that machine learning algorithms can be used to predict Netflix stock prices with reasonable accuracy.
* The best-performing model was a linear regression model, which achieved a mean absolute error of around 0.89 and an R-squared value of 0.99 on the test set. 
* The code and the results of the project are available in this repository, along with the necessary data and documentation.
* The project's insights and findings can be useful for investors and financial analysts who are interested in predicting Netflix's future stock prices.
